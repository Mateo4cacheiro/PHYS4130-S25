### Attribution

The main components of this project were created in the homework assignments (up to simpson's rule, at least). Zeke found the first source, [1], helpful so I used it.

### Timekeeping

This project took about 15-20 hours of work. The main struggles were within the extension questions.

### Languages, Libraries, Lessons Learned
	1. Python was used for the entirity of this project. 

	2. I used numpy and math to.. do math stuff. I used matplotlib.pyplot to create the Legendre plot portion of the project. I used scipy to pull out the weights and roots of the Legendre polynomials.
