# Ethan's Writeup

### Address the following questions in your writeup
 1. What is the difference between capacity dimension[^1] and topological dimension?

 2. Can you replicate Witten and Sander's published capacity dimension?

 3. How does the capacity dimension change as a function of *S*?

### Attribution

The resources I used on this assignment were mainly just fellow students. Mateo taught me how to generate the images of the array and taught me how he incremented his spawn/death radii. I tried to learn from Zeke but when he was explaining his code it was too ugly. Adam helped me understand conceptually what exactly capacity/fractal dimensionality is.

### Timekeeping
The first version of my program, which ultimately failed, probably used about 8-10 hours of my time. The second, non-recursive final version of my program probably took around 15-20 hours over the course of 3 days (2/8 through 2/11).

### Languages, Libraries, Lessons Learned
 1. What language did you use for your program?

I used Python for the entire program. I stuck with it through the entire process, and I honestly learned alot about Python in the process and like it (maybe a little more than C++ now).

 2. What libraries did you use in your submission? Were any of them remarkable? Great to use, super annoying to use, etc?

I used numpy, random, math, time, and matplotlib.pyplot. Numpy, random, math, and time were all really easy to use since they are seemingly so standardized. Matplotlib.pyplot took a bit of tweaking to figure out how to actually display my stuff.
