# Ethan's Writeup

### Introduction

### Overall Work

I think I severely underestimated the time it would take to finish this project and will not make that mistake on any more projects. I also had a lot of problems with my program, which eventually ended with me re-writing my entire program in one weekend (which was obviously not ideal). Due to time constraints and poor time management, I did not end up implementing a stickiness factor. If I had implemented a stickiness factor, I could have gone into much more detail on fractal dimensionality. The architecture of the nested while and for loops was the most time consuming part of the code, as well as just generally tweaking small errors that kept piling up.

### Address the following questions in your writeup
 1. What is the difference between capacity dimension[^1] and topological dimension?

 2. Can you replicate Witten and Sander's published capacity dimension?

 3. How does the capacity dimension change as a function of *S*?

### Attribution

The resources I used on this assignment were mainly just fellow students. Mateo taught me how to generate the images of the array and taught me how he incremented his spawn/death radii. I tried to learn from Zeke but when he was explaining his code it was too ugly. Adam helped me understand conceptually what exactly capacity/fractal dimensionality is.

Some further resources I used were:

### Timekeeping
The first version of my program, which ultimately failed, probably used about 8-10 hours of my time. The second, non-recursive final version of my program probably took around 15-20 hours over the course of 3 days (2/8 through 2/11).

### Languages, Libraries, Lessons Learned
 1. What language did you use for your program?

I used Python for the entire program. I stuck with it through the entire process, and I honestly learned alot about Python in the process and I like it (maybe a little more than C++ now).

 2. What libraries did you use in your submission? Were any of them remarkable? Great to use, super annoying to use, etc?

I used numpy, random, math, time, and matplotlib.pyplot. Numpy, random, math, and time were all really easy to use since they are seemingly so standardized. Matplotlib.pyplot took a bit of tweaking to figure out how to actually display my stuff.
