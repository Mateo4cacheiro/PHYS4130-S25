# DLA algorithm tips

 - What data structure are you using to represent the aggregate?
 - How are you rendering that structure?
 - Computers are fast, but they could be faster. Are there redundant operations in your algorithm?

> [!NOTE]
> Matplotlib's matshow (or imshow) is one good option for raster graphics!

## Display particles by generation/age
It can be nice to see which particles accumulate where.
You can do this quickly by setting the pixel to a value [0,1] proportional to n/N, and applying a colormap to the resulting figure.
The colormap can be continuous, or discrete.
Discrete would let you see where generations of particles wound up.

## Figure tips: trim to DLA, control figure size

You can make your "grid" aka "crystal" numpy array oversized, and then trim to the aggregate's max/min x/y borders.

```python
# Make a simple DLA
particles = 1000
crystal = grow_crystal(N = particles)

# sum columns and rows, identify which elements are not zero
xslice = np.where(np.sum(crystal,axis=0))[0]
yslice = np.where(np.sum(crystal,axis=1))[0]

# calculate the size of the cropped aggregate
whitespace = 2  # don't crop exactly to the edges of the DLA
ypixels = yslice[-1]-yslice[0]+2*whitespace
xpixels = xslice[-1]-xslice[0]+2*whitespace

# approximate the size of the generated figure. This is more than good enough almost always.
figure_ppi = 15  # ppi = pixels per inch
figw = xpixels/figure_ppi
figh = ypixels/figure_ppi+0.375  # add extra space for the figure title

# Create a figure/axis object (this makes systematic figure generation much easier)
# NB you should specify the length and width of the figure (in inches) here.
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(figw, figh))

# slice the "crystal" object on the edges identified with the "where" command.
# NB: you can break a python function call over multiple lines to make it easier to read
_ = ax.imshow(crystal[yslice[0]-whitespace:yslice[-1]+whitespace+1,
                      xslice[0]-whitespace:xslice[-1]+whitespace+1],
               origin='upper',
               interpolation='nearest',
               aspect='equal')

# these optional parameters (origin, interpolation, aspect) are automatically set by matshow,
# but matshow also moves the axes to the top of the 
_ = ax.axis('off')
_ = ax.set_title(f'N={particles}', fontsize=12)  # note the use of an f-string in this command
fig.savefig(f'demo_figure_N{particles}.png',bbox_inches='tight',dpi=150)

# If you *only* want to save the array, and you want to add the title and all figure details separately
# you can call imsave instead:
plt.imsave(f'demo_figure_N{particles}_direct.png',
           crystal[yslice[0]-whitespace:yslice[-1]+whitespace+1,
                   xslice[0]-whitespace:xslice[-1]+whitespace+1],
           )
# This shifts the overhead, and now you'll have to figure out how to scale the resulting png so the figure
# is exactly as large as you want. It's not easier per se, but it's predictable and good to know for LaTeX
# manuscripts especially.
```
