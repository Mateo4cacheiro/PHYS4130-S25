If you are interested in this, I'd recommend following an openfoam tutorial, c++ though.
You could do SWE with finite elements, but generally finite volumes would be your choice to handle any potential discontinuities and is more stable and accurate for practical problems.
Here is a tutorial. [https://www.tfd.chalmers.se/~hani/kurser/OS_CFD_2010/johanPi...](https://www.tfd.chalmers.se/~hani/kurser/OS_CFD_2010/johanPilqvist/johanPilqvistReport.pdf)
