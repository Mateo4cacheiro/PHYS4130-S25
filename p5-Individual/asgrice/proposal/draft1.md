## Finite Element Methods

Current plan is to adapt shallowWaterFoam into python using scikit-fem. The default geometry of the tutorial case is a very simple square hexahedron block, and the mesh consists of a square grid. If I am successful in adapting this case I may attempt to use a different mesh geometry to compare results.

Choosing scikit-fem since it looks like it's pretty well documented and examples are readily available. I plan to start with a simple beam deflection to familiarize myself with how to use the library.
