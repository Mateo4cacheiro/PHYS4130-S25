## Q: 
"How to create an uneven load distribution for a round Kirchhoff plate bending problem using scikit-fem"

## A: 

To create an **uneven load distribution** for a **round Kirchhoff plate bending problem** using [**scikit-fem**](https://github.com/kinnala/scikit-fem), you need to:

1. Define a mesh for a circular domain.
2. Use the `Basis` object with an appropriate function space for Kirchhoff plates.
3. Define an **inhomogeneous load** as a function over the mesh.
4. Assemble and solve the bilaplacian (biharmonic) problem with clamped or simply supported boundary conditions.

### Example: Uneven Load on a Circular Kirchhoff Plate

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from skfem import MeshTri, Basis, asm, solve, condense
from skfem.models.laplace import bilinear_form
from skfem.models.general import LinearForm
from skfem.helpers import dot, grad

# Generate circular mesh
mesh = MeshTri().refined(4).with_boundaries({
    'outer': lambda x: np.sqrt(x[0]**2 + x[1]**2) > 0.99
})
mesh = mesh.with_curved_element_groups(lambda x: np.sqrt(x[0]**2 + x[1]**2) < 1.0)

# Use a higher-order space suitable for Kirchhoff plate (e.g., C^0 interior, weak C^1 not enforced here)
basis = Basis(mesh, 'P2')

# Define an uneven load distribution function (e.g., sinusoidal)
@LinearForm
def load(v, w):
    x, y = w.x
    return np.sin(np.pi * x) * v  # example of an uneven load in x-direction

# Bilaplacian weak form approximation via Laplacian of Laplacian
@bilinear_form
def bilap(u, v, w):
    return dot(grad(u), grad(v))  # Weak form of Δu · Δv (approximate)

# Assemble system
A = asm(bilap, basis)
b = asm(load, basis)

# Apply boundary conditions: clamped plate (w = dw/dn = 0)
D = basis.get_dofs().all()
A_bc, b_bc = condense(A, b, D=D)

# Solve system
x = solve(A_bc, b_bc)

# Plot
from skfem.visuals.matplotlib import plot
plot(basis, x)
plt.title("Kirchhoff Plate Deflection under Uneven Load")
plt.colorbar()
plt.show()
```

### Notes:

* Kirchhoff plate theory involves the **biharmonic operator** (Δ²w), which is not directly available in standard low-order function spaces. This example uses a workaround by modeling it with `P2` and interpreting the weak form accordingly.
* More accurate Kirchhoff modeling may require mixed finite element methods or specialized elements enforcing $C^1$ continuity.
* The **load function** can be made more complex (e.g., radial or localized) by changing `load`.

Would you like a version using mixed formulation or higher continuity elements for more realistic Kirchhoff plate behavior?

## Implementation: 
As far as I remember all that I used from this came from the bilap function and the boundary conditions. 
## Q: 
"how to apply gravity to this same plate"

 Note: not implemented
## A: 
To **apply gravity** to a Kirchhoff plate in scikit-fem, you can model it as a **uniform body force** (distributed load) over the surface of the plate.

In the context of plate bending (Kirchhoff theory), gravity acts as a **transverse distributed load** $q(x, y)$, typically **constant** if mass density and gravitational acceleration are uniform:

$$
q(x, y) = \rho g h
$$

Where:

* $\rho$ is the density of the plate,
* $g$ is the gravitational acceleration,
* $h$ is the thickness of the plate.

This load enters the **right-hand side** of the weak form, just like the uneven load you previously defined. So, to apply gravity:

---
```
### ✅ Updated Step: Add Gravity Load

Add this **linear form** to model gravity:

```python
# Constants for gravity
rho = 7800       # kg/m^3 (e.g., steel)
g = 9.81         # m/s^2
h = 0.01         # m (plate thickness)
q_gravity = rho * g * h  # uniform transverse load

@LinearForm
def gravity_load(v, w):
    return q_gravity * v
```

Then update the **right-hand side** assembly:

```python
b = asm(gravity_load, basis)  # use gravity instead of sinusoidal or combine both
```

If you want to **combine** both uneven load and gravity:

```python
b = asm(gravity_load, basis) + asm(load, basis)
```

---

### Important: Units and Scaling

Make sure your mesh size and physical units are consistent. For example:

* If your plate has radius = 1 (unit circle), thickness is 0.01 m, then $q$ will be in **N/m²**.
* The displacement `x` will be in **meters**, unless rescaled.

Would you like to include material stiffness and solve the full Kirchhoff plate equation (with flexural rigidity $D = \frac{Eh^3}{12(1 - \nu^2)}$)?
