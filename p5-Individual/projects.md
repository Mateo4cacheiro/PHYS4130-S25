# The Project
## Your code
The amount of code that you’ve written will vary based on the project: some depend more on existing libraries than others. I expect well-documented code reflecting meaningful intellectual effort, even if you’re able to largely use a set of existing libraries.

## Your writeup
Much like the other writeups you’ve done this semester, I’m looking for a 5-15 equivalent explanation of the basic theory, the particularities of implementing that on a computer, details of your implementation, and a discussion/analysis of that. If you include more pictures it’ll be longer.

## Your presentation
The last 2, 3, or 4 class days will be presentation days. I expect a 30 minute presentation, accessible to your classmates. Plan 10-15 minutes to set up the background (theory, history, etc), 10-15 minutes to present what you’ve done, and 5 minutes of Q&A from your classmates (and me) (and anybody else who attends)

I’ll use a chunk of class time on a rotating basis to check in with y’all over the remaining class days. This project in its entirety (code, writeup, presentation) will be your final project in this course. There will not be a final exam, and there will not be more assignments after you complete it.

### Languages, Libraries, Lessons Learned
 1. If you changed languages, please remark on that. Otherwise I'll assume you started and finished your work in Python.
 2. What libraries did you use in your submission? Were any of them remarkable? Great to use, super annoying to use, etc?

> [!NOTE]
> This section probably shouldn't more than a few sentences long. Record what you learned and move on!

### Attribution
What resources did you use on this assignment? People, websites, books, etc.

*ONLY REQUIRED WITH GENERATIVE AI:* Include a file titled genAI.md, containing the queries and responses from the AI tool you used. You **MUST** list the following details:
    1. the AI model you used (If you used multiple, indicate which one returned which prompt)
    2. The prompts you supplied
    3. The model's response to the prompt
    4. What part of the generated code you used
    5. What's wrong with the generated code

# Grading
 1. Explanation of undergirding theory
 2. Quality of workflow (including commit history)
 3. Documented implementation of relevant algorithms
 4. Clear and professional presentation of work

# Generative AI

> [!IMPORTANT]
> With full attribution and logged prompts, you may use AI on the programming task. You shouldn't, but you may.

> [!WARNING]
> You may _not_ use generative AI on the writeup.
