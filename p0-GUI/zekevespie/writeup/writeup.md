1. I tried to use Python the whole time, but encountered issues with the plot function in matplotlib.
I imported matplotlib and numpy, but I don't know if the second is even necessary. I wasn't able to get
any plot to be made, so I am very far behind. Mateo and I both encountered the same bug and need to get
it fixed.

2.1 I have no idea what that means.

2.2 It seems like it basically chages how frequently a function call occurs. I didn't get to the buttons 
part of the code, but from my understanding the buttons I would have put in would not have had any debouncing,
since there doesn't appear to be any time-based disabling needed for the buttons.

2.3 Fitzs law is a way web designers design their graphics to grab attention most effectively by adjusting 
the ratio of the size of the graphic with how far the viewer is from it. I would only think it would relate
in making the graphics and charts more pleasant to the eye, but I am not sure.

3. I had some help from Mateo in trying to fix my computer, but we haven't come up with a solution to the
problem we both have with the plotting.
