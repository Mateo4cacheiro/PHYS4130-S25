### Languages, Libraries, Lessons Learned
I have only used Python for the simple code I made. However I did not get anywhere close to making a GUI because I have been troubleshooting matplotlib for hours. I have learned a lot about how to connect to a github repository. At the begining of this assignment I still had know idea what git was or what a repositoty is. Now I have a better understanding for these and am able to successfull push and pull from the github repositoty to my PC. 

When trying to use matplotlib to make a simple plot I was running into an error with "xcb" I spent hours trying to figure out what this is but was unsuccessful. My fellow classemates were also unable to help figure out what my problem is.

### Questions

#### Without looking anything up, answer the following
 1. Do you know what it means to "target compilation for WebAssembly?"
    No, I do not know what this is. But my guess it is has something to do with how we push updates into the github repository and how multiple pushes come together. 

#### Use the internet to answer the following correctly and succinctly
 2. What purpose does a "debounce" serve in a user interface? Did you have to "debounce" your buttons in this gui? Why or why not?
    Cosidering I could not create a GUI because my computer is failing to run simple programs I cant really answer this question. I did some quick google searches on the term "debouncing" on varius sources and found that it has something to do with delaying a fuction's exicution to ensure a function is not called too many times. But thinking about the GUI I can't think of a reason for delaying the excicuteing of a task. I'm sure my answer will change once I am able to properly a GUI. 
 4. What is Fitts's Law? What relevance does it have for a scientific user interface?
    I think Fitt's Law essentially says that the placement of a button on a screen allows for an infinite "target range" or a infinately large space for someone to move a   
    mouse. For example, by placing a button on the edge of a screen the "target range extends to infitity in that direction so it becomes much easier to select the button. I     think this is very useful for GUI design but I don't know why it is useful for scientific user interfaces.
### Attribution
For connecting to github I used lots of forums on Stack Exchange and ask ubuntu (which might be the same thing but I can't tell). For the quesitons on the write up I used https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/debouncing and 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts%27s_law#:~:text=Multiple%20design%20guidelines%20for%20GUIs,derived%20from%20the%20W%20parameter. 
I wanted to dive past the Wikipedia page and look into the sources it cited but I ran out of time before I could. 
### Timekeeping
How long did you spend on this assignment? If you didn't keep an accurate log, an estimate is fine.
I spent between 10 and 12 hours working on this assignment since the end of class on tuesday.
