### Languages, Libraries, Lessons Learned

I used Python and MatPlotLib. I think MatPlotLib was pretty okay to use and it's functions were pretty straightforward.

#### Without looking anything up, answer the following
1. No, I don't know what that means.

#### Use the internet to answer the following correctly and succinctly:
2. It is 1:00 PM, so I will submit this for the time being, but I will have these questions answered before class at 1:30 PM.

### Attribution

I discussed briefly with Adam what languages he was using, and I followed in his footsteps to use Python + MatPlotLib combo. I looked into textualize, but I did not want to use it since it looked too software "engineer"-y.
I usesd the provided tutorials you linked in your .md file (for the button and textbox) and then went from there. I copied alot of the code over and then began to read into what each function does through MatPlotLib's wiki.

### Timekeeping

Probably 3-4 hours? I had to add Git onto my Linux side of things, so that took an extra hour as well. So maybe 4-5 hours total.
